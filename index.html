                    One in three women in Africa would have experienced physical violence by age 15; this is probably higher in Nigeria.
                    One in three women experience physical, sexual or intimate partner violence, are victims of trafficking or are subject to violent social norm.
                    Women and girls are particularly impacted by safety or lack of it in most communities. Safety determines the capacity to move about freely, attend school or even use government services without fear in the morning, afternoon and at night. 
                    We understand the need for cohesive collaboration within the community amongst individuals, neighborhood (policing) security, the police and business owners to help prevent crime and build a safer community where all can thrive with “rights to liberty and the pursuit of happiness”.
